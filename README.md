## Task :man_technologist:
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a command line application using sql. The purpose of the application is to create an employee management system.

The generator can be invoked by using the command: 

```bash
node index.js
```

Once invoked, the command line will the user ask a series of questions that will inquire (see what I did there?...) about what actions the user would like to take. The user can decide whether they would like to add or remove an employee, find employees by department, update a department, etc.
